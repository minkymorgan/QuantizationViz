# QuantizationViz: Image Quantization Demonstration

Welcome to QuantizationViz, an interactive web application designed to demonstrate the effects of image quantization. This tool helps users visually understand how quantization can affect image quality and model performance in AI.

## Project Overview

QuantizationViz allows users to upload images and apply different levels of quantization to see the resulting quality and compression. This process not only demonstrates the core principles of quantization used in compressing AI models but also provides a hands-on experience with its effects on digital images.

## App Introduction

The following screenshot provides an overview of the app's introduction and its educational purpose:

## Quantization Results

After uploading images, the app displays them with different levels of quantization. Below are the screenshots showing the app interface after quantization at various levels:

### First Level of Quantization
