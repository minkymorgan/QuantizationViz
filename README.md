# QuantizationViz: Image Quantization Demonstration

Welcome to QuantizationViz, an interactive web application designed to visually demonstrate the effects of image quantization. This tool helps users understand how quantization impacts image quality and AI model performance.

## Project Overview

QuantizationViz invites users to upload images and apply different levels of quantization to observe the resulting quality and compression. This interactive demonstration elucidates the core principles of quantization, a critical technique used in optimizing AI models.

In the landscape of AI and machine learning, models are often published with various quantization levels, allowing them to be adapted for different hardware constraints and performance needs. However, the impact of these quantization levels on model performance and memory footprint is not widely understood. By visualizing how quantization affects digital images, this application aims to provide a tangible understanding of these impacts, making it easier for users to appreciate the trade-offs involved in AI model compression.

If you would like to explore these concepts further, a live version of the app is available for you to experiment with:
